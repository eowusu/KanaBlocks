KanaBlocks
==========

KanaBlocks is a mobile game designed for teaching the Japanese alphabets (hiragana and katakana) to native english speakers.

There some visual bugs in the settings menu that I still need to work out, and pausing in game causes a visual artifact to block part of the HUD until the user revisits the main menu. I hope to have these bugs worked out soon. The .lua files and be built and run in the Corona simulator by running main.lua.

The KB1.apk can also be simple moved to an android device and run.

There may still be some scaling issues as I have not run the application on anything besides my own HTC device.

(Side note - for the apk file to run on my android device, I had to break the game in the Corona simulator. Right now running the game in Corona displays no readable text, however on an android device the text is clearly visible. If I fix the bug and make the text visible in the Corona simulator, I lose the text on device. Not sure why this is yet)
